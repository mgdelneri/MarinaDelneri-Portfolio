            <p>
              My name is Marina Delneri and I am currently a new student of
              coding and web development. I am based in the United States, but I
              am originally from Brazil and have lived in many places around the
              world. My initial draw to coding came from my life-long love of
              math and logic and learning, as well as a desire to add to and
              expand on my current talents. Additionally, I have always been
              interested in skills that can translate to anywhere in the world.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Although I have had little experience in this field, I find myself
              challenged and invigorated by the material I have learned so far.
              I realize that the study of coding and web development is
              never-ending, and I look forward to always going after more
              material to expand my knowledge on the subject.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              My coding skills are so far centered around the HTML and CSS
              languages, and I am starting to learn about JavaScript. I will
              continue to add to and diversify my skills, as well as add more
              material to this portfolio. I hope to be able to utilize these
              skills in a work environment in the near future, and eventually
              bring them to an industry that I am passionate about, which
              includes hospitality, the arts/music, travel, and the field of
              renewable resources.
