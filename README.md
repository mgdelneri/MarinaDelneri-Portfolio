# MarinaDelneri-Portfolio

GOAL:

The goal of this project was to build a portfolio webpage that showcases my deployed coding projects. This portfolio is intended to set me up for success, as it will eventually be utilized in my future job search. The code for this webpage was to be written from scratch.

The code is meant to feature elements that we have been studying, such as several specific elements of HTML and CSS: flexbox, media queries, a number of different CSS variables, among others. 

The assigned criteria for the portfolio include:
--> Presenting my name, a photo, and links that connect the user to the different sections of the webpage;
--> Sections that show who I am, my deployed projects, and ways to contact me;
--> A larger image for my first project compared to the others;
--> The ability to open the different deployed applications by clicking on the project images;
--> Responsive design elements, allowing the user to view the portfolio on various different types of screens. 

This is an image of the portfolio I created:

Before going into the details of my process, I would like to point out that this portfolio is of course meant to be fluid and updated. I have one project to showcase so far, as seen in the big image. My bio in the "After Me" section will also change as time goes on. Additionally, this is officially my first-ever code written from scratch, so several elements of the webpage and the code can and will be improved upon. 


PROCESS:

The first thing I did was create the skeleton of the webpage in HTML. I then started styling the page in CSS, starting from the top of the webpage to the bottom. This allowed me to figure out what the different containers were, and thus I started adding classes and ids where applicable in HTML. 

The styling in CSS started with simpler elements, such as font styles, font color, and the size of each container. At this point I also added some color to the page, such as the background colors for the whole page and header, so I could have a better idea of how I would like the webpage to look. 

Once the sections of the portfolio became visually clearer, I started applying flexbox elements to each containter, in order to play around with where each of the children elements should fit in their respective parent containers and how they should move around. 

At this point, I started going between the HTML and CSS files, experimenting with different style elements, adding images, and making sure the links worked as desired.

Once images and links were in place, I looked through the code and added accessibility elements where I could, such as adding 'alt' to images and titles to links and images. I also tried changing any div tags to more specific tags. 

At this point, I played around with the code, experimenting with different features, such as color gradient and border-styles. I also used this time to start cleaning up the code, by making both HTML and CSS better semantically, as well as consolidating some code in CSS. 

The last element I added to the CSS code was media query, for better responsive design. 


CHALLENGES:

For me, this project was both rewarding and challenging. As somoeone new to coding, I expected some challenge from the start, but was also excited to see my very own code come to life. 

I think the overarching issue encompassing all of my challenges is a lack of experience. I understand most concepts theoretically, and I know how to apply them in the beginning of the process, for the most part. As the application becomes more complex, I start hitting some road blocks. In these situations, I try researching solutions online and also ask for help from more experienced people. I also experiment with possible solutions and see what works best. This whole process is very valuable, as I think a big part of coding is learning to patiently and effectively deal with road blocks and bugs. 

I acknowledge that my code could most likely be better overall (especially semantically), and I intend on continuing to improve on it as I acquire more knowledge and experience. The area that felt most challenging for me was in the area of responsive design, specifically in applying media queries. This also encompasses getting more comfortable with all of the possibilities in flexbox. 

The other major difficulty I encountered was in relation to git. As time goes on, I am much more comfortable with it, but something happened and my repo in GitHub was split into two different branches. In trying to fix it, I found myself not being able to add more commits to my repo, and so many commits were not recorded. In order to avoid this in the future, I intend on both practicing using git more and asking for help sooner, before trying to fix it all by myself. 


CONCLUSION:

Creating my own portfolio from scratch was valuable in so many ways. Not only was it invigorating to see my own code come to life, but it also allowed for creativity and experimentation. It is also a webpage that is about me and my work, so it will be continuously evolving in content and style. 

Although certain elements on the webpage may currently need improvement both visually and in the code itself, it is a project that begs for constant adaptation as my knowledge and experience grow. I look forward to applying more of what I learn about coding to this wedpage, as well as adding more material to my portfolio.
